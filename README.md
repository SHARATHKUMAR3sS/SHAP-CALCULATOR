9 #FUTURE SCOPE:
10 A calculator is a tool that is used to perform mathematical calculations. 
11 The scope of a calculator can vary depending on the specific model or device, but 
generally,
12 calculators are designed to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, 
subtraction,
13 multiplication, and division, as well as more advanced functions like trigonometry, 
logarithms, 
14 and statistics.In terms of accessibility, calculators are generally easy to use and 
understand,
15 and can be found in a variety of forms, including physical calculators, software 
calculators, 
16 and mobile apps. Many calculators are also designed to be user-friendly for people with 
disabilities,
